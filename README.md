# DataMining

<p align="justify">
Data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.

### The project


<p align="justify">
The main purpose of this work is to apply data extraction methods to predict missing edges of a graph. For this purpose we will apply mining techniques for text and for the graph. For the implementation of the work I used the version 3.5 of Python for the reason of text encoding.
